          <h5>In your own company</h5> 
          <p>
          Each company has their own policies for sexual harassment. These policies should be clearly elaborated in an employee handbook. If you don’t know your employer’s policies or how to raise a concern within your organisation, we recommend you first check the handbook. Then, you can ask your HR representative to explain the process to you. <br>
          <br>
          If you do know the policies and would like to submit a formal grievance letter, Citizens Advice has an online web form to help you build your letter.

         <h5> In a tribunal</h5>
         <h6>Introduction</h6>
          If you can’t resolve your problem by speaking to your employer, you can:
          <ul>Go to an employment tribunal - you’ll have to go through early conciliation first</ul>
          <ul>Agree to settle the case with your employer</ul>
          
          <br>
          Pop-ups
          What is an employment tribunal?
          It’s an independent tribunal responsible for hearing claims from people who think someone such as an employer or potential employer has treated them unlawfully.
          
          What is early conciliation? (FAQ?)
          It’s a process where 2 sides of a legal dispute try to reach an agreement before the case is heard in a court or tribunal. 
          This is typically mediated by ACAS - an impartial government-funded organisation dedicated to resolving workplace disputes 
          !!! Make sure to start this process within 3 months less 1 day from the incident in question!
          
          What does it mean to settle the case with my employer?
          !!! You should get advice from a local solicitor or you nearest Citizens Advice before entering a negotiation like this. 
          Your employer may try to settle the dispute with you outside the courts and employment tribunals.
          An employer only has 2 legal options to do this:
          Negotiate a COT3 agreement through ACAS
          These have the same effect as a settlement agreement, but can only be achieved through ACAS
          Key differences with a settlement agreement:
          Usually much simpler format - ACAS has standard forms
          Can be entered into verbally, provided ACAS is involved in this process
          Relate only to the particular concerns you raised, whereas settlement agreements are typically drafted by the employers’ lawyers so they will seek to settle any and all employment claims as well as put far more obligations on you, the employee
          Usually signed by legal representatives, whereas settlement agreements are signed by employees themselves.
          Negotiate a settlement agreement with you
          This is a legal contract where your employer might promise to pay you a sum of money, stop treating you unlawfully or both.
          Your rights: if you sign a settlement agreement without getting legal advice first, you can still go to an employment tribunal. 
          For this reason, your employer will usually pay for you to get independent legal advice for this negotiation.

          <h5>Employment Tribunal Process Overview</h5>
          Warning!!! 
          <ul>Timeline to submit an employment tribunal claim: 3 months from the date of the incident less 1 day</ul>
          <ul>You should look for an adviser/representative to help you, if possible</ul>
          <ul>Your adviser or representative can help you work out when your time limit starts from.
          Or you can call one of the following helplines:
          <ul>Acas helpline - 0300 123 1100</ul>
          </ul>Equality Advisory Support Service (EASS) helpline for discrimination cases</ul>
          <ul>ET1 form must be received at the tribunal office, not just be posted!</ul>
          <ul>No automatic costs to filing a claim, nor do you automatically have to pay your employer’s legal costs if you lose the case</ul> 
          <ul>Costs orders (one party required to pay another’s legal costs) are only made/approved in less than 1% of cases</ul>
          <ul>You can withdraw your claim by simply writing to the tribunal saying that you want to withdraw your claim</ul>
          <ul>If you wait until your employer has spent a lot of money on your claim, you may be at risk of paying costs</ul>
          
          <br><br>
          <h6>STEP 1 - Notify Acas</h6>
          If you’re intending to make an employment tribunal claim, you need
          to tell Acas first at www.acas.org.uk/earlyconciliation
          They will reach out to you and offer Early Conciliation (time limit to make employment tribunal claim pauses during this process) 
          You decide whether or not to	participate!
          <br>
          If yes, Acas will reach out to your employer and mediate the negotiation
          <br>
          If not, you will need a certificate from Acas to file an employment tribunal claim

          <br><br>
          <h6>STEP 2 - File a claim</h6>
          Now that you have your certificate from Acas you can file a claim with the employment tribunal. This is called an ET1 claim. You can find the link to the online form here: https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunals/make-a-claim)
          Things to remember when filling out the form:
          <br>This is the first document the tribunal will read if the case goes to a hearing
          <br>Give a clear account of what your claim is about. Keep it simple, but mention every key event
          <br>Write in numbered paragraphs
          <br>List events in the same order that they happened
          <br>Don’t worry about using legal language or quoting the law
          <br>Make sure your complaint is covered by the law
          <br>Finally, submit your form
          <br>In England and Wales
          You can find out where to send to in England and Wales here: http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/tribunals/employment/claims/where-to-send.htm
          <br>In Scotland: 
          <br>Central Office of Employment Tribunals (Scotland)
          <br>The Eagle Building
          <br>215 Bothwell Street
          <br>Glasgow
          <br>G2 7TS
          <br> Tel: 0141 204 0730
          <br>Fax: 0141 204 0732
          <br><br>
          If you have a representative, they normally send off the form
          If you have an adviser, make sure you’ve agreed on who’s responsible for sending the form to the tribunal
          You should receive a Notice of Acknowledgement soon after you send in your ET1
          Make sure to check that the tribunal has received the form before the time limit runs out
          
          <br><br>
          <h6>STEP 3 - Employer response, and set a hearing date</h6>
          The employer’s response to your claim is called an ET3. You should receive this about 4 weeks after you put in your ET1
          Simple cases can have a hearing date between 4-6 months after your ET1 form is received
          More complex cases (e.g. discrimination) may take longer
          <br><br>
          <h6>STEP 4 - Hearing</h6>
          If your case is approved, you can go forward with a hearing. Your advisor will be able to guide you through the process
